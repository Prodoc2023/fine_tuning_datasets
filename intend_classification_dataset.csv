user: Hi
bot: Hi, I am Vaidushi and how can I help you today regarding your interest to buy Madhavprash?


user: Please hindi
bot: नमस्ते, मैं वैदुषी हूँ। आप माधवप्राश के बारे में क्या जानना चाहेंगे?


user: क्या फायदा होता है इसे खाने से
bot: माधवप्राश के कई फायदे हैं:

1. **हृदय सुरक्षा**: यह हृदय और अन्य महत्वपूर्ण अंगों की सुरक्षा में मदद करता है, क्योंकि इसमें 80 गुना अधिक विटामिन सी और 40 से अधिक शोधित आयुर्वेदिक जड़ी-बूटियाँ होती हैं।

2. **तनाव नियंत्रण**: इसके हर्बल घटक तनाव को नियंत्रित करने में मदद करते हैं, जिससे उच्च रक्तचाप, मधुमेह और हृदय रोग जैसी स्थितियों के जोखिम को कम किया जा सकता है।

3. **एंटीऑक्सीडेंट प्रभाव**: यह रक्त वाहिकाओं में मौजूद फ्री रेडिकल्स को निष्क्रिय करने में मदद करता है, जो रक्त वाहिका की एंडोथेलियम को नुकसान पहुंचा सकते हैं।

4. **रक्त शर्करा नियंत्रण**: यह रक्त शर्करा को नियंत्रित करने और हृदय की मदद करने में सहायक हो सकता है। 

इन लाभों के लिए, प्रतिदिन एक चम्मच (10 ग्राम) माधवप्राश का सेवन करने की सलाह दी जाती है।

user: कीमत क्या है
bot: एक बोतल माधवप्राश की कीमत 525 रुपये है (GST सहित)। हालांकि, 2 यूनिट खरीदने पर आपको 5% की छूट मिलती है और आप केवल 998 रुपये का भुगतान करते हैं, और 4 यूनिट खरीदने पर आपको 10% की छूट मिलती है, जहां आप केवल 1890 रुपये का भुगतान करते हैं।

user: वजन कितना है
bot: माधवप्राश की एक बोतल का वजन 280 ग्राम है।

user: 1 महीना चलेगा
bot: माधवप्राश की एक बोतल का वजन 280 ग्राम है। यदि आप प्रतिदिन एक चम्मच (10 ग्राम) का सेवन करते हैं, तो एक बोतल लगभग 28 दिनों तक चलेगी।

bot: Could you please provide more details or clarify your query regarding Madhavprash?


user: मधुमेह है मुझे
bot: माधवप्राश मधुमेह के रोगियों के लिए उपयुक्त है क्योंकि यह शुगर-फ्री है और रक्त शर्करा के स्तर को प्रबंधित करने में मदद कर सकता है। कई मधुमेह रोगियों ने इसे सेवन करके समग्र स्वास्थ्य में सुधार और बेहतर शर्करा स्तर संतुलन का अनुभव किया है।

user: How much is effective in heart blockage?
bot: Madhavprash is designed to help protect the heart by lowering blood sugar and cholesterol levels, which can contribute to blood thinning and potentially reduce the risk of heart disease. It contains Ayurvedic herbs and Vitamin C, which may support heart health. However, it is not specifically indicated as a treatment for heart blockage. For heart blockage or any serious heart condition, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

user: And how long we need to take this madhav prash?
bot: Madhavprash should be consumed regularly to maintain the health of vital organs like the heart. Since Vitamin C, a key component, is not stored in the body, regular intake is important. However, for specific duration and dosage, it is advisable to consult with a healthcare professional.

bot: सीने में दर्द और हार्ट अटैक की शंका के लिए, अगर हाल ही में हार्ट अटैक हुआ है, तो 10-15 दिनों का आराम आवश्यक है। इसके बाद, आप अपने रिश्तेदार को माधवबाग में इलाज के लिए ला सकते हैं, जहां उन्हें उचित उपचार मिलेगा।

गर्दन और पीठ में अकड़न के लिए, कुछ सुझाव हैं:
1. सपाट सतह पर सोएं।
2. भारी वस्तुएं न उठाएं।
3. खाली पेट गुनगुने पानी में हींग (असाफोएटिडा) का सेवन करें।

13 से 14 घंटे के कार्य और 5 से 6 घंटे की नींद के लिए, यह महत्वपूर्ण है कि आप अपने कार्य और आराम के समय को संतुलित करें। पर्याप्त नींद और विश्राम आपके स्वास्थ्य के लिए आवश्यक हैं। यदि आपको अधिक सहायता की आवश्यकता है, तो कृपया माधवबाग के निकटतम क्लिनिक में जाएं, जहां हमारे डॉक्टर आपकी स्थिति का आकलन कर सकते हैं और उचित सलाह दे सकते हैं।

Our Blockage Management Program focuses on lifestyle management, which includes proper diet control and regular exercises, along with Panchakarma procedures. These treatments aim to gradually reduce blockages and strengthen the heart's muscular structure. While we cannot guarantee a 100% reduction in blockages, our program has been shown to help reverse heart blockages by 60-70% after full treatment. We recommend starting with a CT Angiography test to accurately measure the blockages, and this test will be repeated after the treatment to assess improvement. Our doctors will guide you through the process and provide personalized advice based on your health condition.

Once the blood pressure is managed, the associated complications, such as numbness, are likely to be reduced.

user: *AN EYE OPENER NOT JUST FOR DOCTORS BUT FOR EVERYONE* 

Before 1979 no expiry date was mentioned on medicines, this practice started in USA in 1979. An article shared by Dr Mohsin Jaffer of Florida, USA_

*DO MEDICINES REALLY EXPIRE OR ARE WE TAKEN FOR A ROYAL RIDE BY PHARMA INDUSTRY.*
By Richard Altschuler

If a bottle of Tylenol, (Paracetamol) for example, mentions ""Do not use after June 1998,"" and it is August 2002, should you take that Tylenol? Should you discard it? Can you get hurt if you take it? Will it simply have lost its potency and do you no good?

In other words, are Drug manufacturers being honest with us when they put an expiration date on their medications, or is the practice of dating is just another *Drug Industry Scam*, to get us to buy new medications when the old ones that purportedly have *expired* but are still perfectly good?

These☝ are the pressing points I wanted to investigate. 

I immediately scoured the medical databases & general literature for the answer to my question about drug expiration labelling. 

And voila I had my answer.
*Here are the simple facts:*👇🏻

FIRST, the *Expiration date, required by law in the United States, beginning only in 1979, specifies only the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of the drug -- it does not mean how long the drug is actually ""good"" or safe to use.*

SECOND, *medical authorities uniformly say it is safe to take drugs past their expiration date -- no matter how ""expired"" the drugs purportedly are*

*Studies show that expired drugs may lose only some of their potency over time*

*Even 10 years after the ""expiration date,"" most drugs do have a good deal of their original potency*. 

*One of the largest studies ever conducted that supports the above points about ""expired drug"" was done by the US Military nearly 18 years ago, according to a feature story in The Wall Street Journal (March 29, 2000), reported by Laurie P. Cohen*

""The Military was sitting on a $1 billion stockpile of drugs and facing the daunting process of destroying and replacing its supply every 2 to 3 years. So it began a testing programme to see if it could extend the life of its inventory. 

*The testing, conducted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ultimately covered more than 100 drugs*, both prescription drug’s and over-the-counter drug’s.""

*The results showed, about 90% of the Drug’s were safe and effective “even 15 years past their expiration date...”*

In the light of these results, a former *Director of the Testing Programme, Francis Flaherty, said he concluded that expiration dates put on by manufacturers typically have no bearing on whether a drug is usable for longer period.*

*The expiration date doesn't mean, or even suggest, that the drug will stop being effective after that, nor that it will become harmful*.

*""Manufacturers put expiration dates for marketing, rather than scientific reasons,"" said Mr. Flaherty, a pharmacist at the FDA until his retirement in 1999*
""It's not profitable for them to have products on a shelf for 10 years. They want turnover."" They created this ingenious way to ‘create’ a market for them. 

The FDA cautioned there isn't enough evidence from the programme, which is weighed towards drugs used during combat, to conclude most drugs in consumers' medicine cabinets are potent beyond the expiration date. 

However, *Joel Davis, a former FDA Expiration-Date Compliance Chief, said that* with a handful of exceptions -- notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics -- *most drugs are probably as durable as those the agency has tested for the military*. 

""Most drugs degrade very slowly,"" he said. ""In all likelihood, you can take a product you have at home for many years."" 

*When Bayer had tested 4-year-old Aspirin, it remained 100% effective*, 

Bayer has never tested aspirin beyond 4 years, Mr. Allen said. 

But Jens Carstensen has.
*Dr. Carstensen, Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin's (US) Pharmacy School*, who wrote what is considered the main text on drug stability, *said, ""I did a study of different Aspirins, and after 5 years, Bayer’s Aspirin was still excellent.” Aspirin, if made correctly, is very stable.*

Now I think I'll take a swig of the 10-year dead package of Alka Seltzer in my medicine chest to ease the nausea I'm feeling from calculating *how many billions of dollars the pharmaceutical industry milks out of unknowing consumers every year* who discard perfectly good drugs and buy new ones *ONLY* because they trust the industry.

Instead, focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce inflammation.

user: Hello
bot: Hello! I am Aisha, a Health-Care Executive at Madhavbaug. Do you have any symptoms or health issues that you would like to discuss?

user: I want to know whether CARE mediclaim is listed with you?
bot: At Madhavbaug, if your CARE mediclaim policy covers treatments under the Ayush Ministry, you can utilize either the cashless facility or seek reimbursement for your treatment. To confirm if your policy includes this coverage, you should contact your CARE mediclaim policy helpline. If your policy does provide this coverage, you will need to visit the hospital for a checkup, as we do not have IPD in the clinics. The doctor will then decide on the treatment plan required, and this will need to be submitted on the hospital letterhead to your insurance company for approval. Once the amount is approved, you can proceed with the treatment.

4. **Overall Health Improvement**: Many diabetics have reported overall health improvements and better-balanced sugar levels after consuming Madhavprash.

5. **No Side Effects**: Made from 100% Ayurvedic herbs and natural ingredients, Madhavprash is free from any side effects.
